Can we help Albert to complete his tasks using the program?
Note 1: For task 8, use the enum type “SearchType{LinearSearch,BinarySearch}” based choice.
Note 2: For task 9, use the relevant C# class with properties and constructor. 
	And construct objects of the class for the ages sequence and then print the objects in tabular format.
