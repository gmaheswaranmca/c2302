	Control Statements 
		Conditional
			Branching/Selection 
				simple if	(without else)					only one option 
				if..else 									two branches of options 
				else..if ladder (for multiple options)		many branches 
			Iteration/Loop
				while loop 			entry-controlled		
				do.while loop		exit-controlled 
				for loop 			entry-controlled 
		Unconditional
			break continue return goto 
		Multiway switch 
			switch expression(variable) is evaluated with label expressions(constant)

Branching/Selection 
	simple if	
		(without else)					
		only one option 
		Examples: 
			o to find maximum of N numbers 
				the comparison along with finding maximum number, we will go for simple if 
			o to check a number is prime number 
				prime number: the number if should be divisible only by 1 and the same number 
				
				check continuously between 2 and number-1 
					if devides the number 
						stop the process 
			o to count number of odd numbers between 1 and 100 
				if the number in the range between 1 and 100 is not divisible by 2
					count continuously 
			o to count number of odd numbers for given N numbers array 
				if the number in the array is not divisible by 2	
					count continuously 
		
	if..else 									
		two branches of options 
		
	else..if ladder (for multiple options)		
		many branches 
		
		Example:
			o menu driven programming to check the option 


switch expression(variable) is evaluated with label expressions(constant)
	o Multiway branching / to go for one of the multiple blocks of code 
	o variable expression mapping to constant expression 
	o Syntax:
		switch(varExpression){
			case constExpression01:
				[statements[break;]]
			case constExpression01:
				[statements[break;]]
			case constExpression01:
				[statements[break;]]
			case constExpression01:
				[statements[break;]]
			case constExpression01:
				[statements[break;]]
			default:
				[statements[break;]]
		}
		
		
		varExpression: 
			o integer expression 
			o character expression 
			o enumeration expression 
			o string expression 
			o boolean expression 
		constExpression01:
			the expression has to be evaluate as constant 
		
loop:
	to repeat the task 
	to repeat the statement(s)
	
while loop 			
	o entry-controlled				
	o Syntax
		while(condition)
			statement;
		
		while(condition){
			blockStatements;
		}
		o Example:
			//initialization;
			while(condition){
				//statements 
				//update part - increment/decrement 
			}
	o minimum number of iteration is zero 
	o when ?
		variable number of iterations 
	
do..while loop 
	o exit-controlled 
	o Syntax: 
		do{
			//statements 
		}while(condition);
		
		Example:
		//initialization;
		do{
			//statements 
			//increment/decrement 
		}while(condition);
	o minimum number of iteration is one
		- loop will execute atleast once 
	o when ? 
		variable number of iterations	
		
		feasible menu-driven program 
		
for loop 
	o entry-controlled loop 
	o Syntax: 
		for(initialization ; condition ; incrementOrDecrement)
			statement;
			
		for(initialization ; condition ; incrementOrDecrement){
			//statements;
		}
	o minimum number of iteration is zero
	o when ?
		10 steps to carry out 
		100 flights info if we update 
		30 students marks are processed 
		
		fixed number of iterations 
			
foreach loop
	o to iterate the elements in the container such as array, list 

recursive function 
	o function that calls itself continuously till the base condition 
	o recursion can become the loop 
	
goto may for the loop 

	
	
			
Unconditional Control Statements:
1. break
	stop the loop 
2. continue 
	stop the current iteration 
3. return 
	stop the function 
4. goto label; 
	it will goto the statement where the identifier "label" is associated as the 'goto label'
