Object Oriented Programming
class: 
	It is a definition for creating objects
	
	!!!It is a blueprint to construct objects 
	
	It is a "user-defined" data type.		*****
	
	Here the term user meant the programmer
	
	It is a reference type.
	
	//Declaration and Initialization:
	Customer c1 = new Customer();		//I
	Customer c2 = c1;

	c1 				new Customer()		
	[	.]--------->[			]
						^
	c2 					|
	[	.]--------------.
	
	//Declaration 
	Customer c1;					//II
	Customer c2;
	//Assignment 
	c1 = new Customer();
	c2 = c1;

	reference type :
		the varaiable created using reference type 
		will not hold the object 
		and will hold the reference of the object 
		so it is called "reference type" 
		
object:	
	object is the physical memory allocations for the object fields 
	and its reference can be asssinged into reference variable 
	to refer the object members 
	
	object is the physical entity created using the type class.
	
define a class:
	class Customer
	{
		//members 
	}
	
to create the object:
	"new Constructor"
	
	If constructor is not defined, 
	compiler will provide "parameterless constructor" 
	
	constructor can be defined explicitly.
	
	The name of the constructor is "CLASS NAME"
	
	return type of the constructor is ?
	constructor will not have any return type.
	
	parameters of the constructor?
	constructor may take take the parameters.
	
	It there is no parameters, 
	then constructor is called "parameterless constructor".
	
	It there is the parameters, 
	then constructor is called "parameterized constructor".
	
	
	class Customer [:BaseClass]
	{
		//members 
	}
	
	Every class will have its base(parent) class.

	If we are definig the base class,
	C# will provide the object as the base class.
	
base class:
	base class is nothing but the class 
	from which new classes will be defined 
	
inheritance:
	class Teacher
	{
		//definition 
	}
	
	class ScienceTeacher : Teacher 
	{
		//defintion 
	}
	
	Teacher is the generalization
	ScienceTeacher is the specialization from the generalization "Teacher"
	
	class CLASSNAME: BASECLASS
	{
	}
	
	In inheritance, 
	we inherit the existing class to new class.
	
	existing class ---> is called base class (parent class / super class) 
	new class --> is called derived class 	 (child class / sub class) 
	
	"inheritance === extension === derivation" are all synonymous for Inheritance 
	
	by inheritance,
	members of the base class is inherited or derived to 
	derived class.
	
	
	class Parent
	{
		//properties - attributes / behaviours(members) 
	}
	
	class Child : Parent 
	{
		//parent properties are inherited 
		//and additional properties (attributes/behaviours) are also added here
	}
	
	by inheritance, reused the base class(parent class) into derived class(child class).
	
	inheritance leads to "reusability" of the existing (composite) type 
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Syntax for inheritance:
	class CLASSNAME : BASECLASSNAME
	{
		//new members of the 
	}
	
	How many base classes we can have?
	
	In C#, we can have maximum only one base class.
	
	ie. In C#, we cannot have more than one base classes.
	
	So, In C#, we will not have multiple inheritance. 
	
	But interfaces can be used to achieve multiple inheritance. 
	
	If we want to use the data hidining,
	cases are two now.
	
	Case 1
		One is base class is not inherited 
		
		attributes of the base class can be private to go for "DATA HIDING"
	
	Case 2
		base class in inherited 
		
		attributes of the base class can be protected to go for "DATA HIDING"
	
	
	Relationship out of inheritance: "is a" relationship
	
	class Teacher
	class ScienceTeacher:Teacher 
	class EnglishTeacher:Teacher 
	class SocialScienceTeacher:Teacher 
	class MathematicsTeacher:Teacher 
	
	ScienceTeacher "is a" Teacher
	EnglishTeacher "is a" Teacher
	SocialScienceTeacher "is a" Teacher
	MathematicsTeacher "is a" Teacher
	
	"has a" relationship 
	
	class Address
	{
	}
	class Teacher
	{
		Address address;
	}
	
	Teacher "has a" Address
	
	
	In object-based language, there will not no-inheritance in the language.
	There how will you define ScienceTeacher using Teacher.
	
	class ScienceTeacher
	{
		Teacher teacher;
	}
	
	ScienceTeacher has teacher
	ie ScienceTeacher contains the teacher as the inner object 
	
	Types of "has a" relationship 
		one-one
		one-many
		many-one 
		many-many 
		
	"has a" relationship is called composition.
	
	
Summary,
		In OOP, we have "is a" and "has a" relationships.
		"is a" relationship meant the inheritance 
		"has a" relationship meant for container object

Inheritance
	Types of inheritance 
		Single Level Inheritance : one base -> one derived class 
			class SchoolStudent 
			class PrimarySchoolStudent:SchoolStudent
		Multi Level Inheritance 	base class -> derived class -> derived derived class ....
			class SchoolStudent 
			class HighSchoolStudent:SchoolStudent
			class FrenchLanguageCreditedHighSchoolStudent:HighSchoolStudent
		Hierarchical Inheritance	one base class -> multiple derived classes 
			class SchoolStudent 
			class PrimarySchoolStudent:SchoolStudent
			class HighSchoolStudent:SchoolStudent
		Multiple Inheritance 		one or more base classes into derived class 
			This is not possible in C#.
			Because, In C#, a class can inherit only one base class. 
			But with interfaces, multiple inheritance is possible. 
			
			Before C# 8.0,
				interface is also a type having only abstract members  
			
			o interface can have more than one base interfaces 
			o interface has to be implmented into the class 
			o And a class can implement more than one interface 
			
			interface IShape
			{
				int FindArea();
			}
			
			by default, interface functions are abstract and also public.
		Hybrid inheritance 
			Mix of the above all the inheritances 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	To define no-implementation(no-definition) function in C#:
	class Shape
	{
		public int FindArea();
	}
	//Wrong in this code 
	
	
	//To fix, "abstract" qualifier is used to declare the function without definition 
	class Shape
	{
		public abstract int FindArea();
	}
	//Wrong 
	//To fix, "abstract" qualifier has to be given to the class as well 
	//        if we have one of the function is abstract in the class 
			
	abstract class Shape
	{
		public abstract int FindArea();
	}
	
	//if class is abstract, then we cannot create the object for the abstract class.
		
	abstract class Shape
	{
		public abstract int FindArea();
		public int FindCircumference()
		{
			//definition 
		}
	}
	
	abstract class Rectangle:Shape
	{
		public override int FindArea()
		{
			//definition 
		}
	}
	class Box:Rectangle
	{
	}
	
	"concrete class"  -> all the functions of the class should have the definitions 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	abstract function: no-definition function 
	class that has one or more abstract functions should be abstract 
	abstract class cannot be intantiated / object created 
	concrete class is one having definition for all its functions 
	abstract class may or may not have the abstract functions 
	abstract class can have functions all defined 
	==> abstract class cannot be intantiated / object created 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Realt-time scenario,
	"abstract class" will have only abstract functions 
	
	interface is evolved?
	
	interface -> we can think pure abstract class 
			but here we cannot declare the attributes 
------------------------------------------------------------------------			
	abstract 	 derived class

	SQLServer 		--> DLL implemented DB
