Case 1
Assume in the school

and few students are with french credited primary school students 

	abstract class SchoolStudent
		abstract void Read() --- no definition  
	class PrimarySchoolStudent:SchoolStudent 
		override void Read() -- definition till name, lang subj, subj marks
	class FCPrimarySchoolStudent:PrimarySchoolStudent
		override void Read() -- definition till name, lang subj, subj, french sub marks 
	
Case 2
Assume in the school
they have policy that all the primary school students should take the credit "French Language"
	
Option 1:
abstract class SchoolStudent
	abstract void Read() --- no definition  
abstract class PrimarySchoolStudent:SchoolStudent 
	//override void Read() -- definition till name, lang subj, subj marks
class FCPrimarySchoolStudent:PrimarySchoolStudent
	override void Read() -- definition till name, lang subj, subj, french sub marks 	
	
Option 2:	
abstract class SchoolStudent
	abstract void Read() --- no definition  
abstract class PrimarySchoolStudent:SchoolStudent 
	override void Read() { } // empty definition 
class FCPrimarySchoolStudent:PrimarySchoolStudent
	override void Read() -- definition till name, lang subj, subj, french sub marks
