overloading
	the same named function with different prototypes (signatures, declarations)
	
	then functions call will be resolved 
	with arguments in number 
		 arguments order 
		 arguments datatypes
	
overriding

Questions:
1. Create class 
	class Shape 
		public int FindArea(int breath,int height)		-> triangle 	-> breath * height
		public float FindArea(int radius)    				-> circle 		-> radius
		public int FindArea(int length,int width, int height)		
												-> box surface area 	-> 
													(2*l*w) + (2*w*h) + (2*l*h)
	clas MainClass
		Main 
			Shape shape = new Shape();
			Read breath and height for triangle 
			Then find the area of the triangle 
			Read radis of the circle 
			Then find area of the circle 
			Read length, width and height of the box 
			The find area of the box 
			Print area of the triangle, circle and box one by one 

Test Case	
	Input 
		Enter Triangle Details 
		Enter breath : 5 
		Enter height : 6
		Enter Circle Details 
		Enter radius : 10
		Enter Box Details 
		Enter length: 4		8x2=16
		Enter width: 2		12x2=24		
		Enter height: 6		24x2=48	
	Ouput
		Area of the triangle is 15
		Area of the circle is 31.4
		Area of the box is 88

2. class Account
		- accountNumber
		- accountHolderName
		
		public void Read()
		{
		}
		public float CalculateInterest()
		{
			return 0;
		}
   class SI: Account 
		- principle:float		--->	P
		- duration:int 		---> 	N
		- rateOfInterest:float	--->	I
		public void Read()
		{
		}
		public float CalculateInterest
		{
			//define code 
		}
   class CI: Account 
		P 			attributes
		R 
		n 
		t 
		A 
		public void Read()
		{
		}
		public float CalculateInterest
		{
			//define code 
		}
		
   override the CalculateInterest
   Main 
		Read the P(principle) N(duration - number of years) R(rate of interest) details from keyboard
		Create object of class SI and assign into Account reference variable account 
		Then print the CalculateInterest() value 
		Create object of class CI and assign into Account reference variable account 
		Then print the CalculateInterest() value 

Test Case:
Input 
	
Output
	Simple Interest is 
	Compound Interest is 


Simple Interest = PNR/100
Compount Interest 
A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
n = the number of times that interest is compounded per unit t
t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for

P (1 + r/n)^nt - P

If an amount of $5,000 is deposited into a savings account at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded monthly, the value of the investment after 10 years can be calculated as follows...

P = 5000.
r = 5/100 = 0.05 (decimal).
n = 12.
t = 10.

If we plug those figures into the formula, we get the following:

A = 5000 (1 + 0.05 / 12) (12 * 10) = 8235.05.

So, the investment balance after 10 years is $8,235.05.
   
3. class Student 
	To create a class student and 
	create 2 methods storeDetails and displayDetails in it. 
	create another class Mark that inherites details of student and 
	create another 2 methods getMarks and displayDetails 
	to calculate and display marks of 2 subjects.
		
4. Create 2 classes Square and Cube 
	to find the area and surface area respectively, 
	using the same method Area. 
	
	class Square 
		public int FindArea()
	class Cube : Square 
		public int FindArea()


Example from FN session to demonstrate the overloading:
	Create a class Calculator that has 2 methods named Add, 
		One to add two integers and 
		the other to add to strings. 
   Print both the output in the main program.
