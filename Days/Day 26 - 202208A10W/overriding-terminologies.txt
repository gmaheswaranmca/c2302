virtual function: 
	o the function with "virtual" qualifier 
	  and with definition is called virtual function 
	  
	o virtual function is overridable 
	

override function:
	o the function with "override" qualifier 
	  and it will have redefinition of the base class function 
	
	o to redefine the base class function in DERIVED class
	  in the base class we have to add the qualifier "virtual" or "abstract" or "override"

	o virtual function is overridable 
	o abstract function is overridable 
	o override function is overridable 

abstract function:
	o the function with "abstract" qualifier 
	and without definition is called abstract function 
	
	o abstract function class has to be qualified with "abstract"
	
	o abstract function is overridable 
	
abstract class:
	o the class with "abstract" qualifier is called abstract class 
	
	o abstract class can have abstract functions 
	o abstract class may not have abstract functions 
	
	o abstract class cannot be object created 
		-- if abstract class is inherited into derived class 
		and derived class has to define all the abstract functions if any 
		then derived class canbe object created 
		
	Example:	
		BASE CLASS of three abstract functions has to be abstract 
		DERIVED CLASS if defined all the abstract function, then it may be concrete ie object creatable
		DERIVED CLASS if not defined few abstract functions, then it also has to be abstract
