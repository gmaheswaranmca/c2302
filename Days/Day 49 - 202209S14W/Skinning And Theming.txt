Theming and Skinning
	The terms Theming and Skinning mean something very specific in WPF. 
	
Theming	
	Theming refers to a Windows theme like Aero or Luna. 
	In each Windows version (XP, Vista, Win 7) 
	thereâ€™s a different default Theme 
	where controls like a Button or a Progress Bar look different. 
	
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) 
styling and templating refer to a suite of features 
that let developers and designers create visually compelling effects and 
a consistent appearance for their product. 
When customizing the appearance of an app, 
you want a strong styling and templating model 
that enables maintenance and sharing of appearance within and among apps. 
WPF provides that model.
