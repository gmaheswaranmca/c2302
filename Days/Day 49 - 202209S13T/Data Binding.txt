Data Binding:
	Binding of UI property to "other clr property"
	
	
	clr property
		- UI property 
		- object property 
		- object property of the collection 
		
	For Collection binding we use ItemSource
	For Single Data binding we use DataContext for the container like layout or window
		
	Binding Mechanism is connected with three things 
		Source 					!!! Data Provider 
		Target					!!! Data Consumer 
		Path with which Soruce and Target are bound 
		
		
		Slider to TextBox 
		Source    Target 					<------------------------ Source.Value is the Path 
		
		
		Form UIs 		Product Object
		Target 			Source 				<------------------------ Object.<Property> is the Path 
		
		TextBox to TextBox 
		Source 		Target 					<------------------------ Source.Text is the Path 
		
		
		Using Mode of the Binding 
			we can achieve 
				One Way Binding 		Slider to TextBox 		<----- Value of Slider is the Path, Mode=OneWay 
				Two Way Binding 		Slider to TextBox 		<----- Value of Slider is the Path, Mode=TwoWay
