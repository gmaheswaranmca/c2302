1. class with one method 					| test 
2. derive it override here 					| test 
		3. assign into parent class reference and call method 
		4. copy parent reference to child reference and call method 

1. class with no-implementation method 		| test ???

1. interface with a method 
2. inherit interface into another interface with another method 
3. implement (2) into class 

1. interface with a method 
2. another interface with a method 
3. inherit (1) and (2) into third interface 
4. implement (3) into a class 
5. implement (1) and (2) into a class 

1. create a sealed function class 
2. inherit (1)

1. create a sealed class 
2. inherit (1) check 
   if syntax error, create object to call its function 
   
1. create a class with a abstract function 
2. inherit just	-- dont implement ???  
3. inherit (2) -- implement first one 

1. create a class with a abstract function 
2. inherit just	-- implement it and make method as sealed 
3. inherit (2)  -- try override the method ??? error. if so, just create object.
