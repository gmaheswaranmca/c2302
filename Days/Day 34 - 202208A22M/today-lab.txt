exception handling:
	exception is unexpected event like runtime error 
	
	exception handler can handle the exception 
	
		try
		{
		}
		catch()
		{
		}
		catch()
		{
		}
		[finallly
		{
		}]
	
	why do we use handler?
		To continue the program execution after exception is raised and 
		hanlded properly.
	
	user-defined exception:
		derived exception class from class Exception 
	
Lab Exercise:
