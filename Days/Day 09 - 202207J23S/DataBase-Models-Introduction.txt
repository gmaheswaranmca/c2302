	flat file database: 
		- text
		- binary 
		
		- sequential access
		- random access 
		
		
		logical structure for the data to store into "persistent store"
		decided by the programmer 
	
	database models 
		Hierarchical model 
			tree like data arrangement 
				one-one
				one-many 
				many-one
		Network model 			
			graph like data arrangement 
			- best model for the data 
			- poor model for the storage 
				one-one
				one-many 
				many-one 
				many-many 
		
		DBMS 
			format of the data is fixed: 
				table 
			DB (DataBase) is a collection of data tables.
			
			table synonymous/similar terms: tuple, relation, record
			
			data table : 
				columns 
					definitions of each attribute/column 
				rows 
					data 
			
			Oracle was the famous and market leader for RDBMS
		RDBMS
			Relational DBMS - it deals the relationships with DBMS as well 
				one-one
				one-many 
				many-one 
				many-many
			
		Object based data base model 
			Tried to implement object based data base model 
			
			
			
		Object-Relational database model 
			Hibrid of object & relation DBMS 
			
		Evolution of the javascript:
			JSON (Javascript Object Notation)
			POJO (Plain Old Java Object) 
			
			flight:
				flight_id	flight_number 	source destination 
				
			flight_id	flight_number 	airline_name	source  	destination	travel_date
			101	AI 1242	Air India	Mumbai	New Delhi	23-07-2022
			
			{flight_id:101,	flight_number: "AI 1242", airline_name:	"Air India",
			source: "Mumbai" 	,
			destination: "New Delhi",
			travel_date: "23-07-2022"}
			
			document(json)-based data model - NO-SQL
