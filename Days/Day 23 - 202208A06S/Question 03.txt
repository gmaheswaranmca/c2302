Question:
Create a class “Flight” with the following members:
	Fields:
		flightNumber	- int
		sourcePoint
		destinationPoint
		noOfSeats
		ticketFare
		noOfBookedSeats
		noOfAvailableSeats
		totalBookingAmount
		
		nextFlightNumber – static, to assign flightNumber automatically
		
		noOfAvailableSeats = noOfSeats - noOfBookedSeats
		totalBookingAmount = noOfBookedSeats * ticketFare

	Methods:
		Flight()			- constructor to assign nextFlightNumber into flightNumber and increment nextFlightNumber	
		Read()				- Read the fields from keyboard other than flightNumber, noOfAvailableSeats and totalBookingAmount
		Calculate()			- Update the fields noOfAvailableSeats and totalBookingAmount 
		BookATicket()		- Increase a noOfBookedSeats
		CancelATicket()		- Decrease a noOfBookedSeats
		Display()			- Print the fields  
		DisplayNextFlightNumber() – static method

		static Flight() 	– static constructor to initialize nextFlightNumber
		
	Write a Main method and construct ‘3’ flights.
	
	Do booking and cancellation for using do..while loop till "Do you continue?" is "yes"
	Each time the booking or cancellation we have to pick the flight and do
	Print flights details at the end 
	
	At the end print total turnover(all flights booking amount together) collected 
	
	Note: Use "this" reference for object fields inside object functions/constructors
	Note: Use no-argument constructor to initialize the first flight 
		Use parameterized constructor to initialize the second flight 
			parameters are sourcePoint, destinationPoint, noOfSeats, ticketFare
		Use Flight object constructor to initialize the third flight 
			parameter is "Flight flight"


Test Case:
Input:
	Enter 3 flight details source, destination, no of seats, ticket fare in each line:

	Total Turnover: 37500
	Next Flight Number is 100104
	
	
1. Like Question 1		without multiple constructors, BookATicket, CancelATicket 
2. Question 1 
	--> Multiple constructors 
		--> Each constructor is defined individually 
3. Internal calls between constructors using "this constructor"	call 
4. Introduce functions BookATicket, CancelATicket
5. Single Menu Driven without do..while loop for BookATicket, CancelATicket
6. Do..while base menu driven for BookATicket, CancelATicket
	
	
DisplayAfterRead()		
	This is printing the flight details in a line 


flight2.GetTotalBookingAmount()	returns value of field "totalBookingAmount"
	why this function? 
		to sum up all the totalBookingAmount outside 
		we wrote this function to read each flight's "totalBookingAmount" outside the function 
	what is the alternative?
		Otherwise we can change accessibility of "totalBookingAmount" as "public"
