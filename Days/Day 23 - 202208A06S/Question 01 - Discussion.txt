Question 1:
	Class members (static)
		static constructor 
		static member field 
		static member function 
	Object memers (non-static)
		object constructor
		object member field 
		object member function 
	Client(/Main/Driver) Code
		
		
o static/class-level members we will access with CLASSNAME and dot operator 
o non-static/object members we will access with object reference and dot operator 
o static member field 
	- variable declared inside the class with qualifier "static"  is called static member field
	- static field is class-level scoped member 
	- static field is memory allocated for the entire class 
	Note: field,attribute,data,variable are synonymous 
o static constructor
	- the class named constructor with qualifier "static" is called static constructor 
	- static constructor will not have return value 
	- static constructor will not have arguments
	- it is no-argument no-return value special function 	
	- it is used to initialize the static fields 
o static function 
	- the function qualified with "static" keyword and accessed using the class name 
		is called static function 
	- the static function can access the static fields or 
		call other static functions 
	- the static function should not access the object fields/functions 
o object member field 
	- variables declared without static qualifier at class level are the attributes of the object 
	- Those object member fields will be accessed by the object's reference 
o object constructor 
	- the class named special function without static qualifier to inialize the object member fields 
	is called object constructor 
	- object constructor will not have the return value 
	- object constructor may have arguments  
		So 
		argument construcor 		
		no-argument constructor (if there is no constructor defined, 
			then by default no-argument constructor will be with the class)
o object member function 
	- the function without static qualifier to operate on member fields is called object member function 
	- member function will become service functions of the object 
	- member function's main objective is to operate on object fields 
	      leads to ---> Encapsulation 
				leads to ---> Data Hiding
